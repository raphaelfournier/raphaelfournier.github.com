I recently decided to move my custom-made personal homepage and my
blogger-powered blog onto a single website. I stumbled upon
[jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a "blog aware, static site generator". It can be
freely hosted on [github](http://github.com), via github-pages. There is no
database and every page and post are written in markdown (or another outlining
language). The source is located in a folder on my site and are controlled via
git. If you want a similar website, you can clone the
[repo](https://github.com/raphaelfournier/raphaelfournier.github.com) and look
for the user-contributed
[plugins](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Plugins).

Three jekyll bloggers, among the
[others](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/sites), inspired me for building
this site:

* [stammy](http://www.pstamatiou.com)
* [jos√© diaz gonsalez](https://github.com/josegonzalez/josediazgonzalez.com)
* [kevin sornberger](http://www.ksornberger.com)

You may also have a look at other static html generators, such as pelican,
nanoblogger or hyde. I have tested the first two, they were great but jekyll is
better (in terms of plugins, community and the bonus of github hosting).

The only issue I still have to figure out is how to neatly publish post in
French and English. The authors of
[sp4ce.net](http://www.sp4ce.net/site/2011/01/15/how-to-have-a-multilingual-website-with-jekyll.html)
and [drivemeup](http://drivemeup.github.com/) have kind of succeeded in doing
this, but I need some time to see how I can adapt there solutions to this blog.

However, jekyll and github are really great!
