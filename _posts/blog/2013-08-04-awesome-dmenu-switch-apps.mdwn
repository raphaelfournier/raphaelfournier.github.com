I have been using [Awesome][] as a window manager for several years. It uses a
tiling approach, and really _manages_ windows, maximizing available space on my
12" laptop screen. A great addition is [dmenu][], created by the [suckless][]
project. The first use is to pipe applications from the path, which dmenu
presents as a horizontal/vertical list, with incremental search. 

But dmenu is not limited to this, and wrote a small function which proposes a
menu of currently running applications (or clients, as awesome calls them). The
selection may be refined by typing a few character which appear in the name of
the app or the tag. When selecting enter, the tab changes to the client and it
is given focus.

Here is the code:

        local awful= require("awful")
        local beautiful = require("beautiful")
        local naughty   = require("naughty")
        local client=client
        local pairs=pairs
        local table=table
        local print=print

        local dmenuhelpers = {}

        dmenuopts = "-b -i -nf '"..beautiful.fg_normal.."' -nb '"..beautiful.bg_normal.."' -sf '"..beautiful.bg_urgent.."' -sb '"..beautiful.bg_focus.."' -fn '-*-dejavu sans mono-*-r-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*'"

        function dmenuhelpers.switchapp()
          local allclients = client.get(mouse.screen)
          clientsline = ""
          for _,c in ipairs(allclients) do
            clientsline = clientsline .. c:tags()[1].name .. " - " .. c.name .. "\n"
          end
          selected = awful.util.pread("echo '".. clientsline .."' | dmenu -l 10 " .. dmenuopts)
          for _,c in ipairs(allclients) do
            a = c:tags()[1].name .. " - " .. c.name 
            if a == selected:gsub("\n", "") then
              for i, v in ipairs(c:tags()) do
                awful.tag.viewonly(v)
                client.focus = c
                c:raise()
                c.minimized = false
                return
              end
            end
          end
        end

To use it, you need to add the following in your rc.lua:
  
* at the top

        local dmenuhelpers = require("dmenu-helpers")

* in the key table

        awful.key({ modkey, "Control" }, "w", function () dmenuhelpers.switchapp()                                        end),
