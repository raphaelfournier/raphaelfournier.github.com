While typing in a Bash shell, one may want to enable the [TAB] completion even
when sudo or man was typed before the command. Just add the following lines to
your ~/.bash_profile :

    complete -cf sudo
    complete -cf man

and you're done ! There are plenty of powerful features in "bash-completion"
package, we'll see that later on this blog, too much work at the moment.
