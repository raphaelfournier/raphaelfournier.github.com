<H1>Hello!</h1>

<p>I work in the LIP6 laboratory (in Paris) with the ComplexNetworks team, as a
Ph.D student. My research interests are related to P2P networks and Internet
measurement. This website is my personal homepage, which I intend to improve in
the future. For more information about my professional activities, see <a
  href="http://www.complexnetworks.fr">my team's website</a>.
