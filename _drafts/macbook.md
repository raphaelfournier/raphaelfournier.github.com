I have been a ArchLinux-only user since november 2008, when I switched from my
WindowsXP-Ubuntu double boot. I have never looked back, and have learned a lot.
I have discovered several tools and workflow practices that I have grown
accustomed to and find difficult to get rid of. However, in October 2014, for
professional reasons, I bought a MacBookAir. I, obviously, rushed to install a
double boot between MacOS X and Archinux. It works rather well. I now have a
first-hand experience with the OS made by Apple.

For people willing to do the same (coming from Linux and moving onto OS X), I
have decided to write a list of the most annoying quirks. Note that, while I
have 5 years of workflow tuning in Linux, I only have a few weeks of OS X, so my
experience is mostly based on the vanilla Mavericks edition of this OS.

Pros

Cons
- system-wide font tuning
- window management
